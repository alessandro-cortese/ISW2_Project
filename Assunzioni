Project Assumption:
- I consider in the calculation of the value of proportion only the issues with OV != FV (otherwise the dominator would be 0);
- I round th index of the injected release calculated with proportion by defect;
- I assume that tickets resolved on the same on the same day as the release of a new release are resolved in that release;
- I calculate the fixedVersion as the version after the resolutionDate of the ticket on Jira;
- I perform the proportion calculation on all known repositories, even those later than the version to which we are applying proportion;
- I consider the release date of versions to sort them.
