Project Assumption:
- I consider in the calculation of the value of proportion only the issues with OV != FV (otherwise the dominator would be 0);
- I round th index of the injected release calculated with proportion by (excess/defect?);
- I assume that tickets resolved on the same on the same day as the release of a new release are resolved in that release.
