Assumptions:
- I perform the calculation of proportion by considering the denominator of the formula equal to 1 in the case where issues have OV == FV.
- I round the index of the injected release calculated with proportion by default.
- I assume that tickets resolved on the same day as a new release are resolved in that release.
- I calculate the fixed version as the version following the resolutionDate of the ticket on Jira and the opening version as the version following the createDate of the ticket on Jira.
- To order the versions I take their release date as a reference.
- If more than one ticket is mentioned in a commit, I consider the commit as resolving all the tickets mentioned.
- I calculate the incremental proportion value using all valid tickets prior to the ticket I am considering. A ticket is valid if it has iv < ov < fv.
- Empty or comment LOCs are also considered in the calculation of LOCs.
- SMOTE is used only if the number of true instances is greater than 1. By default it needs at least 5 true instances, but I have added a control that adjusts this number dynamically.
