Project Assumption:
- I perform the calculation of proportion by considering the denominator of the formula equal to 1 in the case where the issues have OV == FV;
- I round th index of the injected release calculated with proportion by defect;
- I assume that tickets resolved on the same on the same day as the release of a new release are resolved in that release;
- I calculate the fixed version as the version after the resolutionDate of the ticket and the opening version how the next version of createDate on Jira;
- To sort versions I take their release date as a reference;
- If multiple tickets are mentioned in a commit, I consider the commit as resolving all the tickets mentioned;
- I calculate the incremental proportion value using all valid tickets prior to the ticket I am considering. A ticket is valid if it has iv < ov < fv;
- Empty or comment LOCs are also considered in the calculation of LOCs.
